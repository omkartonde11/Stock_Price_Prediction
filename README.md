### How to create Alpha Vantage API

To access financial market data from Alpha Vantage, you need to create an API key. Follow these steps to obtain your API key:

1. **Visit the Alpha Vantage Website**: Go to the Alpha Vantage website at [https://www.alphavantage.co/](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

2. **Sign Up for an Account**: If you don't already have an account, click on "Sign Up" and provide the required information to create an account.

3. **Sign In to Your Account**: After creating an account, sign in using your credentials.

4. **Navigate to the API Key Page**: Once logged in, click on your profile icon at the top right corner of the page. From the dropdown menu, select "My Account."

5. **Generate Your API Key**: In your account settings, you'll find the option to "Create API Key." Click on it, and Alpha Vantage will generate an API key for you.

6. **Copy Your API Key**: Once generated, you'll see your API key on the screen. Copy this key and keep it secure.

7. **Use Your API Key**: Replace `"MY API KEY"` in the project code with your actual Alpha Vantage API key to access financial market data.
